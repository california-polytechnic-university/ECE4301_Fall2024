ABSTRACT 

This project presents the use of end-to-end lightweight encryption to develop a secure chat application.
Implementing secure cryptographic algorithms such as RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) for key exchange and AES 
(Advanced Encryption Standard) for message encryption and decryption on a single board computer (SBC). 
This secure chat application provides real-time password-protected communication with an intuitive user
interface enabled with avatar depictions and emoticons, built with Flask and Socket.IO. Performance metrics
such as memory usage and latency are logged to evaluate server efficiency of the SBC Raspberry Pi 5.
Integrating cryptographic algorithms on a Raspberry Pi 5 offers security solutions for industries in need
of secure communication. One of the major challenges in developing this secure chat application is implementing
efficient encryption and decryption mechanisms. Managing RSA key exchange between the server and the client
requires careful handling to ensure compatibility across different cryptographic libraries and platforms. 
Additionally, optimizing AES encryption for real-time message processing poses another challenge, as it 
is important to maintain a balance between strong security and minimal latency to provide a seamless 
user experience.
