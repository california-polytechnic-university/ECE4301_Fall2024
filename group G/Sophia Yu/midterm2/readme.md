# Hybrid Cryptography for Secure File Transfer and Communication
This project demonstrates a hybrid cryptography system for securely exchanging random values, deriving a shared symmetric AES key, and using it to encrypt/decrypt a video file between a Host PC and a Raspberry Pi (PI). The system uses RSA for secure key exchange and AES for efficient symmetric encryption.
